# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
We have completed the initial setup phase and moved into the core implementation phase of the Black and White Board application. The current focus is on:

1. Testing and refining the drawing functionality
2. Implementing and testing the undo/redo functionality
3. Preparing for the infinite canvas implementation
4. Planning the OPFS storage integration

## Recent Changes
- Set up the basic project structure with directories for styles, scripts, and assets
- Initialized npm and installed development dependencies (Vite, ESLint, Prettier)
- Configured Vite as the build tool with development, build, and preview scripts
- Set up ESLint and Prettier for code quality and formatting
- Created the HTML structure with canvas and toolbar elements
- Implemented CSS styles for the main application, canvas, and toolbar
- Developed the core JavaScript functionality:
  - Main application logic (app.js)
  - Canvas component for drawing (canvas.js)
  - Toolbar component for UI interactions (toolbar.js)
- Implemented basic drawing functionality with color selection
- Added placeholder functionality for save/export features
- Added MIT license to the project root
- Created Vite configuration to output builds to the /docs folder for GitHub Pages hosting
- Updated package.json license field to MIT
- Fixed file paths to use relative paths instead of absolute paths for GitHub Pages compatibility
- Updated Vite configuration to use relative base paths

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Enhance the drawing functionality
   - Improve the drawing experience with smoother lines
   - Test and refine the undo/redo functionality
   - Add an eraser tool

2. Implement the infinite canvas
   - Research and implement canvas panning
   - Develop viewport management
   - Optimize performance for large drawings

3. Integrate OPFS storage
   - Implement save/load functionality
   - Develop whiteboard naming and management
   - Create a file management interface

### Upcoming Tasks
1. Implement infinite canvas with panning
2. Add OPFS storage integration
3. Develop SVG export functionality
4. Implement whiteboard naming
5. Add comprehensive error handling
6. Perform cross-browser testing

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions
- **Vanilla JS vs Framework**: Successfully implemented with vanilla JavaScript for maximum compatibility
- **Canvas Implementation**: Decided to use canvas context for drawing with plans to implement panning using transformations
- **Command Pattern**: Implemented for drawing operations to enable undo/redo functionality
- **Storage Strategy**: Planning to use a structured approach in OPFS with metadata for each whiteboard
- **SVG Generation**: Basic implementation in place, needs refinement for complex drawings

### Open Questions
- How can we optimize the drawing history to prevent excessive memory usage for complex drawings?
- What's the most efficient approach for implementing smooth panning on the infinite canvas?
- How should we handle SVG export for very large drawings?
- What's the best way to structure the OPFS storage for efficient retrieval and management?

### Current Challenges
- Ensuring smooth drawing performance across different devices
- Implementing efficient panning for the infinite canvas
- Developing a robust OPFS storage system
- Generating optimized SVG output from canvas drawings
- Maintaining a clean, minimal UI while adding more features

## Development Environment
- Local development setup complete with npm and Vite
- Development server running with hot module replacement
- ESLint and Prettier configured for code quality and formatting
- Project structure established with clear organization
