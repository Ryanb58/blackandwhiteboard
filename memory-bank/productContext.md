# Product Context

## Purpose
The Black and White Board application is designed to provide a digital canvas for outlining simple or complex concepts during screenshares or to share with people directly. It serves as a visual communication tool that allows users to quickly sketch out ideas, diagrams, and explanations.

## Problems Solved
- **Real-time Visual Communication**: Enables users to visually communicate concepts during live screen sharing sessions
- **Concept Documentation**: Provides a way to document and share visual explanations
- **Flexible Drawing**: Offers an infinite canvas that adapts to various concept sizes and complexities
- **Persistence**: Allows saving and retrieving drawings for future reference
- **Portability**: Generates SVG files that can be used in other applications

## How It Should Work
The application provides a minimalist interface with the canvas as the primary focus. Users can:
- Draw freely on an infinite canvas
- Select from 6 different pen colors (with black as default)
- Undo and redo actions
- Name and save whiteboards locally using OPFS
- Export drawings as SVG files to their local machine

## User Experience Goals
- **Simplicity**: The interface should be intuitive with minimal learning curve
- **Responsiveness**: Drawing should feel natural with no perceptible lag
- **Reliability**: Work consistently across supported browsers (Chrome and Firefox)
- **Accessibility**: Basic operations should be accessible via both mouse and keyboard
- **Efficiency**: Common actions (changing colors, undoing) should require minimal clicks
- **Distraction-free**: UI elements should be minimal and non-intrusive to maintain focus on the canvas

## Target Users
- Professionals explaining concepts during virtual meetings
- Educators teaching concepts to students
- Team members collaborating on ideas
- Individuals documenting personal concepts or ideas
