# Project Progress

## Current Status
**Project Phase**: Core Implementation
**Overall Progress**: 30%
**Last Updated**: March 9, 2025

## What Works
- Project documentation and planning is complete
- Memory bank structure has been established
- Architecture and component design has been defined
- Basic project structure is set up
- Development environment with Vite, ESLint, and Prettier is configured
- HTML canvas is implemented
- Drawing engine with basic functionality is working
- Color selection with 6 colors is implemented
- Initial UI layout with toolbar is complete

## What's In Progress
- Testing and refining the drawing functionality
- Implementing undo/redo functionality
- Preparing for infinite canvas implementation

## What's Left to Build

### Phase 1: Core Drawing Functionality (90% Complete)
- [x] Basic project structure
- [x] HTML canvas setup
- [x] Drawing engine implementation
- [x] Basic pen tool with different colors
- [x] Initial UI layout

### Phase 2: Enhanced Drawing Features (50% Complete)
- [x] Multiple pen colors selection
- [x] Undo/redo functionality (implemented but needs testing)
- [ ] Eraser tool
- [ ] Toolbar UI implementation

### Phase 3: Infinite Canvas (0% Complete)
- [ ] Canvas panning implementation
- [ ] Viewport management
- [ ] Zoom functionality (if decided to include)
- [ ] Performance optimizations for large drawings

### Phase 4: Storage and Export (0% Complete)
- [ ] OPFS integration
- [ ] Save/load functionality
- [ ] Whiteboard naming
- [ ] SVG export implementation
- [ ] File management interface

### Phase 5: Refinement (0% Complete)
- [ ] UI polish and improvements

- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Cross-browser testing
- [ ] Bug fixes and refinements

## Known Issues
- Drawing by dragging in the browser needs further testing
- Undo/redo functionality needs more thorough testing
- Save and export functionality are currently placeholders

## Blockers
- None currently

## Next Milestone
**Target**: Enhanced drawing features and infinite canvas
**Estimated Completion**: TBD
**Key Deliverables**:
- Working canvas with drawing capability
- Basic color selection
- Initial toolbar layout

## Recent Achievements
- Completed initial project planning
- Established project documentation structure
- Defined system architecture and component design
- Outlined technical approach and constraints
- Set up development environment with Vite, ESLint, and Prettier
- Implemented basic project structure
- Created HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the application
- Implemented drawing functionality with color selection
- Created toolbar UI with color picker and utility buttons
- Added MIT license to the project root
- Configured Vite to build to the /docs folder for GitHub Pages hosting

## Notes
- The project has moved from planning to implementation phase
- Core drawing functionality is mostly implemented
- Focus will be on creating a minimal viable product with the essential drawing features before adding more complex functionality
