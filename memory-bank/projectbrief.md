This project is a white/black board for anyone to use.

Think of it as an infinite canvas.

There are 6 colors of pens to select, with black being the default.

It should have an undo and redo button.

The user should be able to name each whiteboard.

The app stores all data locally on the users computer using OPFS.

The files saved to OPFS can be exported to their local machine.

The files it generates should be .svg files for compatibility beyond this whiteboard app.
